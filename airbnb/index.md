Welcome to D.C.! We're delighted to share our home with you. Here are a few notes for navigating the house and the city.

## Internet

The network name is **Guest Network** and the password is **airbnb2015** -- if you ever have trouble with the connection, feel free to reboot the router by turning it off and on. The router is the black plastic device located just outside your room on the bookcase.

## Contact & Emergencies

Tom can be reached at 703-944-7654. Steph's number is 609-865-7490. If you encounter an emergency, dial 911. DC's non-emergency assistance line is 311. We keep a fire extinguisher in the hallway closet on the bottom floor of the unit.

## Getting Here

D.C. is served by three **airports**:

- **Reagan National (DCA):** this is the closest and most convenient airport. Unless you have a lot of bags, you should take the Metro.

- **Dulles (IAD):** Metro's recently-opened Silver Line makes Dulles easier to get to, but until 2018 you will still have to pay to take a shuttle from the airport to the Wiehle station. Alternately, the 5A Metrobus will drop you at the Rosslyn or L'Enfant Plaza Metro stations. Shared-ride van service is available, but unless you are traveling alone, it's not much cheaper after tip than a taxi or Uber.

-**Baltimore/Washington (BWI):** not much further than Dulles, BWI has similar transport options. The one big difference is the availability of the MARC train, accessible via a free shuttle ride from the airport. [You can find details here](http://www.bwiairport.com/en/travel/ground-transportation/trans/marc). MARC will drop you at Union Station, just a mile or two from our house (and one stop away on the Metro's Red Line). Alternately, the B30 bus will take you from BWI to the closest Metro station. Shared ride vans, taxis and Uber are also available. 

**Trains** arrive at Union Station, which is one Red Line Metro stop away from our home. Alternately, you can take a bus or car up North Capitol. We're 1.6 miles directly north of Union Station.

If you're **driving** to D.C., you will find our home very conveniently located, with the minor irritation of a complicated intersection as you get off the highway.

-**From the North** take the Baltimore-Washington Parkway into the city. As you come down a bridge that crosses train tracks, turn right onto Florida, then right onto Eckington Place, then left onto Q. *Watch your speed!* There are many speed cameras as you enter the city. The speed of traffic is not a good guide to how fast you should be traveling over that final stretch. Be sure to slow down once you pass the Washington Times building.

-**From the South:** the directions are a bit more complicated, but it's just as close. [Here is the most direct route, with lots of pictures](http://cl.ly/1h131R3M0V2m/directions.pdf) (PDF, 14M). A simpler option is to follow signs to Union Station, then drive up North Capitol.

-**From the West:** Come in on I-66 and follow signs for 395 N. Then use the directions for approaching from the south.

## Parking

On-street parking is usually available. You will need to display our visitor parking pass on your dashboard. We keep this pass on the fridge -- [it looks like this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qgzvF9_VOOs/VItcNOKw3iI/AAAAAAAAVxk/ARpf93mHlso/s1600/DDOT%2BVisitor%2BParking%2BPass%2B2015.PNG). Please be sure to return it to us.

## Locks & Keys

When you first arrive, please ring the doorbell for unit 2 and we will greet you. If for some reason we will not be home when you arrive, we will make arrangements beforehand to get you the key.

Our doors feature programmable keypad locks. **We will set the locks on the front and back door to the last four digits of your mobile phone number prior to your arrival**. To enter, simply enter those numbers, then turn the tumbler clockwise. When leaving, press the "Schlage" button at the top of the keypad and turn the tumbler counterclockwise. [Here's a video of it in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etNyAGugGss).

You will need a key for the outer front door when entering from the front. We will give this to you when you arrive. If you forget this key, you can always come in the back. Just head up the spiral staircase. Our driveway has a large green shed, so it's easy to recognize the house from behind.

If you have questions about how any of this works, please let us know. We're counting on you to be careful to lock the premises whenever you leave. 

## The Room, TV, Food

Your room is upstairs, toward the back of the house. Please make yourself at home. We use the closet and the linen cupboard for storage, but the rest of the space is at your disposal, including the attached private deck. We'll keep your door shut to keep kitty out, and ask that you do the same, especially if you're going to leave the patio doors open.

Please feel free to use the television on the lower floor -- pick up the remote control and hit the button next to "Apple TV" to get to Netflix or HBO Go. We don't have a cable subscription, but broadcast channels work just fine. If you'd like to watch something in your room, let us know and we can easily wheel a TV cart over to you with a Roku and Chromecast.

Help yourself to the books in the house if any catch your eye, but please double-check that you've returned them before you go.

We ask that you not cook any meals while you're here. Steph has serious food allergies, and we need to keep the environment safe for her. But if you need to use dishes for takeout, to microwave something, or to make coffee or tea, please feel free to do so. The restaurants listed on our AirBnB profile are our favorites in the neighborhood.

We've left some mugs, a french press, coffee and tea, as well as a hot water kettle in your room.  If you use these, please bring the cups and french press downstairs so we can refresh it for the next morning.

Help yourself to the fruit and granola bars in the wooden bowl in the living room. If you'd like a bigger breakfast, we suggest [Big Bear](http://www.bigbearcafe-dc.com/) or [Kafe Bohem](http://www.kafebohem.com/).

## The Cat

We have a somewhat cranky cat, Romy. Steph is the only person she genuinely likes. For you, Romy is likely to be either an indifferent or downright bad host. Please just ignore her, and accept our apologies for her poor manners. She has no front claws, so she can't hurt you. She will probably hide during your stay, and if not, we'll do our best to keep her from annoying you.  Please don't try to pick her up or pet her.

## Getting Around

There are a number of easy ways to move through the city. We suggest you use these rather than driving, as parking can be expensive or unavailable at many of the city's most popular attractions.

- The Metro system is excellent; the red line's NoMa/Galludet station is just half a mile away. [Here's a system map](http://www.wmata.com/rail/maps/map.cfm?). Fares vary with distance, but a trip within the city is usually $2-$4. You will want to buy a [SmartTrip card](http://www.wmata.com/fares/smartrip/) from a machine in the station--the old paper magstripe passes are being phased out, and now carry significant surcharges for use. Also, the older cards aren't inter-operable, so they won't work on the bus.  Visitors most often use the Smithsonian station to access sites on the Mall, or the Woodley Park station to get to the zoo. Farragut North is closest for visiting the White House, and Capitol South is the closest stop to the Capitol and Botanical Gardens.

- Our home is near a number of useful bus lines. You can use your SmarTrip card to board, or pay $1.75 in cash (note that the bus driver cannot give you change). You can use [Nextbus](http://nextbus.com) to estimate bus arrivals. Google Maps can help you identify which bus to take if you use the "transit directions" option. Among the lines you might want:

    - The 90, 92 and 93 run from North Capitol and Florida up through U Street and then to Adams Morgan, past a variety of dining and nightlife options. You'll want to board at the northwest corner of the North Capitol/Florida intersection.
    - The 80 and P6 run south down North Capitol to Chinatown and the Verizon Center, a great area for theater and sports. The 80 goes all the way to the Kennedy Center, if you happen to have opera or symphony tickets.
    - The G2 is a few blocks away, at 3rd Street Northwest, but will take you through Dupont Circle and on to Georgetown.

- [Uber](http://uber.com), and especially the less expensive UberX service, is our preferred way to get around when we need a car. If you aren't already an Uber user, let us know: we can send you a referral code that carries a credit which should cover your first ride. Trips to most parts of the city are ten dollars or less with UberX.  Unlike a taxi, it is not customary to tip an Uber driver.

- [The Capital Bikeshare system](http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/) is convenient and easy to use -- there's a station one block from the house. You can use a credit card to buy a day pass at any station. When you take out a bike, you have 30 minutes to drop it at another station. Once you do, you can take another bike out immediately. You can keep a bike for longer, but doing so will incur fees.  Sometimes it can be hard to find a station with bikes or with open docks--particularly during rush hour--so be sure to check bike and dock availability with the [station map](http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/stations) or the free [Spotcycle app](https://www.spotcycle.net/). When you unlock a bike, get it out of the dock by lifting it by the seat for a few inches, then dropping it--that's how the pros do it.

- Zipcar, Lyft and Car2Go are also present in D.C., if you're already a member of one of those services.

## Things to See and Do

Any guidebook will point out the classic things to see and do in D.C. You should see and do them! The zoo is great, the museums are world class, and this is a wonderful town to visit. Close to home, the bars and restaurants in Bloomingdale are mostly excellent. We'll be glad to offer tips if you want to talk through your options. Sites like [DCist](http://dcist.com/) and [the City Paper's various blogs](http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/) are also great ways to figure out what's going on. 

But if you want something different, here are a few suggestions:

- If it's summer, check out the free [Fort Reno](http://fortreno.com) outdoor concert series, a venerable institution and community event for the city's aging post-punk rockers. It is not uncommon to spot a famous musician or two under the trees, watching a not-very-good high school band try their best as the sun sets behind them. There are kids, dogs and tattoos everywhere. Grab a sandwich from Whole Foods on your way from the Tenleytown Metro--just remember not to bring alcohol or glass bottles to the park. It's all utterly charming, and you might even find a hidden gem.

- Getting to [Hains Point](http://www.recreation.gov/camping/hains-point-picnic-area-east-potomac-park/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&parkId=114702) will require a car, but from there you can swim in the outdoor public pool, use the driving range, or play a quick nine holes with the Washington Monument in the background. Or just share a pitcher of beer and try to spot the foxes running across the grounds at dusk.

- [Union Market](http://unionmarketdc.com/) is a foodie paradise that's just a short walk from our house. It is a completely renovated market space in the middle of a bunch of dilapidated warehouses -- don't be scared by the approach, you're going the right way! You'll find a variety of delicious things, plus an [Angelika Movie Theater](https://www.angelikafilmcenter.com/dc). Just beyond Union Market is the [Dolcezza Gelato Factory](http://dolcezzagelato.com/locations/factory/), which offers tours on the weekend. For a trip back to the market before its reinvention, check out [A. Litteri](http://alitteri.com/), an Italian grocery with excellent sandwiches that has been a D.C. institution for almost a century.

- Eat some Ethiopian food! D.C. has many great restaurants, but most of the region's best cheap international cuisine is in the suburbs. Ethiopian is the one big exception. [Zenebech](http://www.zenebechdc.com/) is walkable from our house and does a great job. For a more ornate presentation, consider [Dukem](http://dukemrestaurant.com/) on U Street--they often perform music and/or a coffee ceremony for guests.

- In addition to its symphonic and operatic shows, the Kennedy Center hosts free performances every day on its [Millennium Stage](http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/millennium/). Better still, the 80 bus runs right from our house to its front door (plan on a 45 minute ride, but don't worry about transfers). [Wooly Mammoth Theater](http://www.woollymammoth.net/) and [Synetic Theater Company](http://www.synetictheater.org/) also offers reliably great shows. The [9:30 Club](http://www.930.com/) is one of the country's best rock venues and the [Black Cat](http://www.blackcatdc.com/) offers cheap drinks in the Red Room and great shows upstairs.  The Raven is the city's best dive bar, but our neighborhood bar, Showtime, runs a close second.
